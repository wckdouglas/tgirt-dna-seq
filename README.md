# Facile single-stranded DNA sequencing of human plasma DNA via thermostable group II intron reverse transcriptase template switching #

The work is published in [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-09064-w). 

Basically, there are three parts of the work:

* E-coli genomic DNA sqeuencing comparison (TGIRT vs NexteraXT [Illumina Basespace Project 21071065]) 
    * codes in *genome_tgirt_seq*
* Plasma cell-free DNA-seq (TGIRT vs [ssDNA-seq](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26771485))
    * codes in *plasmadna-tgirt*
* Bisulfite sequencing of plasma cfDNA
    * codes in *bisufile-seq*
